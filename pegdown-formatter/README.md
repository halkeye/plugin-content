# Pegdown formatter plugin - Deprecated

This plugin is deprecated. It has not been released in over 12 years. It has a known [security vulnerability](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-08-07/#SECURITY-142).

Instead use the [**Markdown formatter plugin**](https://plugins.jenkins.io/markdown-formatter/).

## Features

-   Use [PegDown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown) to format
    [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
    syntax in descriptions in Jenkins, eg, view, job, build, the system
    message, etc.
-   Disable HTML to prevent XSS
-   Enable/ disable all of the PegDown extensions

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with any version of **Jenkins** (1.396+)

## Install

This plugin can be installed from the Plugin Manager (Manage Jenkins \>
Manage Plugins) under "User Interface".

To install manually, download the latest plugin from
<http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/plugins/pegdown-formatter/> and use the
Upload Plugin option in the Advanced tab of the Plugin Manager.

## Configure

In Manage Jenkins -\> Configure Global Security, select "Enable
security".  
Next to Markup Formatter, select "PegDown" from the drop down list.

To ensure that Jenkins does not lose configuration when you return to
the Configure System page, make sure that you select one of the Security
Realms.  
To leave Jenkins "open" select "Jenkins's own user database" and "Anyone
can do anything" under Authorization.
